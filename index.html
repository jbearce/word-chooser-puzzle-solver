            <p>Suppose you have a puzzle where words have to be made. 
                The word has a set length, and each character in the 
                word is chosen from its own pile.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, let's say you have a 4-letter word.<br />
                Character 1 can be any of:<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A, C, R, G<br />
                Character 2 can be any of:<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; N, F, C, L, E, J<br />
                Character 3 can be any of:<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O, D, N, E<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                This can form words "red", "and", "ale", and possibly more. Use the puzzle 
                solver below to find all words that can be made from your puzzle.
